Reflect is a daily notebook: press ⌘D any time to land on today's note and write.

- **Link as you think.** Type \`[[\` and a title — [[Wiki Links]] connect notes. There are no folders.
- **Find anything.** ⌘K searches your whole graph; ⌘/ lists every shortcut.
- **Your files.** Every note is a markdown file in this folder, portable forever.

When you want more, open Settings (⌘,):

- **Backup** — free, private backup of your graph to GitHub.
- **AI providers** — add your own API key to chat with your notes (⌘J). Notes marked private never leave this device.

This note is pinned to the sidebar — unpin it (⌘O) when you're done.

/**
 * Seed the welcome note into an **empty** graph (no markdown under `daily/`

 * never write into it. The caller supplies the other half of "brand new":
 * the graph provider only seeds on a root's first-ever open
 * (`GraphInfo.firstOpen`, Rust's fact from the recents store), so a graph
 * someone emptied on purpose is never re-onboarded. Returns whether a seed
 * happened.
