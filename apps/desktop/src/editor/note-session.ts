/**
 * The save pipeline + external-change reconciliation for one open note
 * (Plan 05 steps 4–5), as a pure state machine — no React, no editor, no IPC.
 * `useNoteDocument` adapts it to React; tests drive it directly.
 *
 * A session is created for one `path` and lives until {@link NoteSession.dispose}.
 * Binding the path at construction is what keeps the machine simple: a note
 * switch is "dispose the old session (which flushes its buffer to *its* path),
 * create a new one" — there is no cross-note state to guard.
 *
 * Saves are debounced atomic writes (Plan 02); indexing is **not** triggered
 * here — the watcher is the sole incremental-reindex path (Plan 04b), so our own
 * write flows file → watcher → index like any other change. The same watcher
 * event comes back to us; we recognize the echo by content (it matches what we
 * last saved) and ignore it. A real external change reloads a clean buffer
 * imperatively, and **never clobbers a dirty one** — it parks as `conflict` for
 * the user to resolve.
