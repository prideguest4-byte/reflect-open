# Porting note templates

**Status: shipped.** The editor slash-menu entry point rides meowdown's new
host-items API ([prosekit/meowdown#192](https://github.com/prosekit/meowdown/pull/192)),
currently consumed via a pkg.pr.new pin in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — swap it
for the real `@meowdown/*` bump when the release lands.
The [product vision](../reflect-v2-product-vision.md) deferred templates
with "markdown snippets may be enough" — and that is exactly the design:
templates are markdown files in the graph.

## What v1 did

Templates were per-graph named blocks of rich content, managed in
**Preferences → Note Templates**, stored in the cloud account, and inserted
via the editor's slash menu. New graphs were seeded with three starter
templates (**journal**, **person**, **company**). There was no variable
substitution — bodies were inserted verbatim.

## How it will work in v2

### Templates are files

A `templates/` folder at the graph root, as a sibling of `daily/` and
`notes/`:

```text
my-graph/
├── daily/
├── notes/
├── templates/
│   ├── journal.md
│   └── person.md
└── .reflect/
```

Each markdown file is one template; its title (H1 or filename) is the name
shown when inserting. That single decision buys almost everything v1 had to
build:

- **Editable anywhere** — in Reflect or any text editor; the file watcher
  picks up changes like any other file.
- **Per-graph scope and sync for free** — templates live in the graph and
  ride the git backup, so every device sees them; no account storage, no
  separate sync path.
- **Versioned** — template history is git history.

### Inserting a template

- **Command palette** (`mod+k`): an "Insert template…" command lists the
  templates in the current graph and inserts the chosen body at the cursor.
- **Editor slash/insert menu**: meowdown's insert affordances (slash menu,
  block-handle `+`) gain host-provided items so templates appear alongside
  built-in blocks — same host-supplies-the-items pattern as wikilink
  autocomplete.

Insertion is verbatim, matching v1: links, tags, tasks, and headings paste
in as written. Frontmatter in a template file (if any) is not inserted.

### Managing templates

Templates are files first: creating, renaming, and deleting all work from
any text editor or file manager, and the watcher picks the changes up. In
the app, **Settings → Note templates** lists them with open / rename /
delete rows, and a "New template" dialog (also a palette command) creates
`templates/<slug>.md` seeded with the name as its H1. Renaming moves the
file onto the new name's slug, carrying any open editor session; deleting
sends the file to the trash. Templates open in the normal editor, but title
edits do **not** rename the file (the rename pipeline's slug targets live
under `notes/`) — the settings rename is the in-app rename.

## v1 → v2 mapping

| v1                                          | v2                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Stored in the cloud account, per graph      | Markdown files in `templates/`, per graph          |
| Managed in a preferences page               | Managed as files; edited in the normal editor      |
| Inserted via the editor slash menu          | Command palette + meowdown insert menus            |
| Seeded starter templates on graph creation  | None seeded (no-litter contract); docs show examples |
| No variable substitution                    | Same — verbatim insertion, at least initially      |
| Newest-first list in prefs, A→Z in menu     | A→Z everywhere                                     |

## Explicitly not ported

- Starter templates written into every new graph — scaffolding stays
  minimal; the docs carry copy-pasteable **journal**/**person**/**company**
  examples instead.
- Duplicate-name tolerance quirks: filenames make names unique per graph by
  construction.

## How it was built

- **Indexing.** `templates/*.md` is indexed like any note, with a new
  `notes.kind` column (`daily` / `note` / `template`, migration 0014,
  projection v12) derived from the path. Every note surface — All Notes,
  search, backlinks, tasks, pinned, tag facets, wikilink autocomplete and
  resolution, graph stats, the CLI — excludes `kind = 'template'`; the
  `note_keys`/`backlinks` views enforce the wikilink rule at the schema
  level. Templates are never embedded, so AI retrieval can't see them.
- **Insertion.** The picker reads the file, strips frontmatter, and inserts
  the body as a parsed fragment at the cursor
  (`NoteEditorHandle.insertMarkdown`) — one undoable edit with paste
  semantics.

## Open questions

- **Daily-note templates.** v1 never auto-applied a template to daily notes
  and users asked for it constantly. A designated `templates/daily.md`
  applied to new daily notes is a natural v2 extension, but it interacts
  with the lazy "no file until first keystroke" contract — deferred to its
  own decision.
- **Variables.** `{{date}}`-style substitution is deliberately out for
  parity, but the files-first design leaves room for it later without
  migration.
